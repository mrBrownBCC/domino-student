# Goal
Become familiar with the box2d library. Modify the snowman shape to be a full snowman. 

# Setup steps:
1. Forward port 6080
2. Open Lwjgl3Launcher.java. This file contains the main method you will use to test your code. 

# Additional Resources:
[Box2d with libgdx](https://libgdx.com/wiki/extensions/physics/box2d#initialization)
If this is blocked on school Wifi, a pdf copy is available on Canvas. 

# Programming Instructions:
0. Go to core > src > Main to write your code. 
1. Write your code within the addAllDominos method. Make the coolest domino setup that you can! Use the createPlatform and addDomino methods to help - you won't need to directly make box 2d method calls. 

# Testing:
To test your code, interact with the GUI you create! Click run with the file Lwjgl3Launcher.java open. This can be found in /lwjgl3/src/main/java/bcc/snowman/lwjgl3.
The running version of your project will be available at the forwarded address from port 6080. 

# Publishing:
Run 
```
1) npm run build
2) npm i gh-pages
3) npm run deploy
```

# Submission:
To submit, publish your project on github sites. Then share the link in the canvas discussion and the all task assignment. As a best practice, please save your work as well:
```
1) git add . 
2) git commit -m "Saving my code, because it is cool and I don't want it to dissapear when this codespace is deleted."
3) git push
```
This will save your project forever and ever, so that it is not deleted with the codespace you are currently using.
